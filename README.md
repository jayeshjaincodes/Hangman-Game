## Overview:
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a secret word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess results in the drawing of a hanging man, and if the player fails to guess the word before the drawing is complete, they lose.






### Technologies:

**Python:** The game logic is written in Python, utilizing its simplicity and versatility.    
**Pygame:** The Pygame library is used to create the graphical user interface, providing a visually engaging gaming experience.




## How to Play:

```
**3 .** Run the hangman.py file to start the game.
```bash
